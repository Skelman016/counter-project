## Description

This project is a simple interactive **counter** with a **presentation card** that appears after the counter reaches a specific value. The project allows the user to increment and decrement a counter, with visual feedback when the counter reaches certain milestones, and includes a button to reveal a personal profile card.

### Key features:
- A **counter** with + and - buttons to increase or decrease the value.
- A **message** that updates based on the counter value (e.g., "Reach 50 to meet me" and "Keep it up!").
- A **presentation card** that includes a profile image, links to social profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub), and a personal portfolio.
- The presentation card appears when the counter reaches a limit, providing the user with an engaging interaction.

## Features

- **Interactive counter** that updates dynamically.
- **Responsive design** to ensure usability across different screen sizes.
- **Personal profile card** with links to social media and portfolio.
- **CSS animations and transitions** to enhance the user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for the structure and content.
- **CSS3** for styling.
  - Flexbox for layout management.
  - CSS transitions for smooth animations.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic DOM manipulation.
  - Event listeners for button interactions.
  - Real-time updates based on user input.
